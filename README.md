### Introduction

Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data
using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding
and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio comparable to the best
currently available general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed
with deflate but offers more dense compression.

The specification of the Brotli Compressed Data Format is defined in [RFC 7932](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7932.txt).

### Build instructions

#### Make

To build and run tests, simply do:

    $ ./configure && make

If you want to install brotli, use one of the more advanced build systems below.

#### Bazel

See [Bazel](http://www.bazel.io/)

#### CMake

The basic commands to build, test and install brotli are:

    $ mkdir out && cd out && cmake .. && make
    $ make test
    $ make install

You can use other [CMake](https://cmake.org/) configuration. For example, to
build static libraries and use a custom installation directory:

    $ mkdir out-static && \
      cd out-static && \
      cmake .. -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=0 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX='/my/install/dir/'
    $ make install

#### Premake5

See [Premake5](https://premake.github.io/)

#### Python

The basic commands to build, test, and install the Python module are:

    $ python setup.py build_ext test
    $ python setup.py install

See the [Python readme](python/README.md) for more details.
